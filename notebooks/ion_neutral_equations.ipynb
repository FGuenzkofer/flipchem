    "# Origin of ion-neutral collision equations used in `msis.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following briefly explains the origins of the ion-neutral collision equations used in `msis.py`. First, the equation for ion-neutral collisions is taken from the year 2000 edition of \"Ionospheres: Physics, Plasma Physics, and Chemistry\" by Schunk and Nagy.\n",

    "## Maxwell molecule collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for collisions of Maxwell molecules (eq 4.88) and reduced mass (eq 4.98) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nu_{in} = 2.21 \\pi\\frac{m_{n} n_{n}}{{m_{i} + m_{n}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_n e^{2}}{\\mu_{in}}}, \\quad \\mu_{in} = \\frac{m_{i} m_{n}}{m_{i} + m_{n}}$$\n",

Also, in `msis.py`, we have opted to use AMU instead of kilograms. As a result, we cannot simply use the above equation as is without including some unit conversions.\n",
